This creates a secure and transparent environment that allows even the children who may otherwise be shy or afraid to speak up, to confidently voice their opinions. During Quality Circle Time, children develop key social skills, such as waiting for their turn to speak, listening to others, respecting differing opinions, and abiding by rules. Class bonding and unity are also solidified in this manner, and children are engaged in all areas of development. The sessions may be concluded with a few energizing games, stories, or activities.<p style="text-align:right;"><img src="https://manthanschool.org/images/circle.jpg" width="560" ></p>
